Input:
edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[3,4],[2,4]]

Initial Graph Construction:
Adjacency List:
1 -> [2, 3]
2 -> [1, 4]
3 -> [1, 4]
4 -> [2, 3]

Indegree Array:
1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2

Initial Queue (Nodes with Degree 1):
Queue is empty (no node with degree 1)

Finding Redundant Edge

Now that the pruning process is skipped, the algorithm moves on to the second part, which checks the edges in 
reverse order to identify the redundant edge.

It starts from the last edge and works backwards, checking if both nodes of the edge still have an indegree of 2, 
which would mean the edge is redundant.

The algorithm does this with the following loop:

for (int i = edges.Length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    int u = edges[i][0], v = edges[i][1];
    if (indegree[u] == 2 && indegree[v] > 0) 
        return new int[] {u, v};
}
The first edge to be checked in reverse order is [2, 4].
Indegree of 2 and 4 is 2 after pruning.

/*
Redundant Connection

You are given a connected undirected graph with n nodes labeled from 1 to n. 
Initially, it contained no cycles and consisted of n-1 edges.

We have now added one additional edge to the graph. The edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to n, 
and was not an edge that previously existed in the graph.

The graph is represented as an array edges of length n where edges[i] = [ai, bi] represents an edge between nodes ai
 and bi in the graph.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the graph is still a connected non-cyclical graph. 
If there are multiple answers, return the edge that appears last in the input edges.

Example 1:
Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[3,4],[2,4]]
Output: [2,4]

Example 2:
Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[3,4],[4,5]]
Output: [3,4]

Constraints:
n == edges.length
3 <= n <= 100
1 <= edges[i][0] < edges[i][1] <= edges.length
There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the input.
