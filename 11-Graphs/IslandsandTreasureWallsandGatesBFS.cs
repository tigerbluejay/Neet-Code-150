/*
Islands and Treasure / Walls and Gates

You are given a 
m√ón 2D grid initialized with these three possible values:

-1  - A water cell that can not be traversed.
0   - A treasure chest.
INF - A land cell that can be traversed. We use the integer 2^31 - 1 
= 2147483647 to represent INF.

Fill each land cell with the distance to its nearest treasure chest. 
If a land cell cannot reach a treasure chest than the value should remain INF.

Assume the grid can only be traversed up, down, left, or right.

Modify the grid in-place.

Example 1:
Input: [
  [2147483647,-1,0,2147483647],
  [2147483647,2147483647,2147483647,-1],
  [2147483647,-1,2147483647,-1],
  [0,-1,2147483647,2147483647]
  ]
Output: [
  [3,-1,0,1],
  [2,2,1,-1],
  [1,-1,2,-1],
  [0,-1,3,4]
]
Example 2:
Input: [
  [0,-1],
  [2147483647,2147483647]
]
Output: [
  [0,-1],
  [1,2]
]

Constraints:
m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 100
grid[i][j] is one of {-1, 0, 2147483647}
