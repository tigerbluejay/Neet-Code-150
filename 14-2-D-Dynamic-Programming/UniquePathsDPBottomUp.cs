This algorithm uses bottom-up dynamic programming to count the number of unique paths 
from the top-left to the bottom-right of an m Ã— n grid, moving only right or down. 
It initializes a 2D array dp with dimensions (m+1) x (n+1) to store the number of paths 
from each cell to the goal.

The key insight is that the number of paths from a cell (i, j) equals the sum of the 
paths from the cell directly below it (i+1, j) and the cell directly to its right (i, j+1). 
The base case is that there is exactly 1 path from the destination cell (m-1, n-1) 
to itself.

The algorithm iterates the grid backward, filling each cell with the sum of its right 
and bottom neighbors. By the time it reaches the top-left cell (0,0), this cell contains 
the total number of unique paths from the start to the finish.

âœ… 3) Grid of Computed Paths for Input m = 3, n = 6:
Below is the final dp table that the algorithm builds (same grid as before, just 
calculated bottom-up instead of top-down):


[ 21][ 15][ 10][  6][  3][ 1]
[  6][  5][  4][  3][  2][ 1]
[  1][  1][  1][  1][  1][ 1]

This grid shows the number of unique paths from each position to the bottom-right corner 
(2,5). As expected, dp[0][0] = 21, which is the answer.

/*
Unique Paths

There is an m x n grid where you are allowed to move either down or to the right at 
any point in time.

Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that can 
be taken from the top-left corner of the grid (grid[0][0]) to the bottom-right corner 
(grid[m - 1][n - 1]).

You may assume the output will fit in a 32-bit integer.

Example 1:
Input: m = 3, n = 6
Output: 21

Example 2:
Input: m = 3, n = 3
Output: 6

Constraints:
1 <= m, n <= 100
