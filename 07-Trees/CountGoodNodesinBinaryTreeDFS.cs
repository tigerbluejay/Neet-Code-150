When you call GoodNodes(root), it does the following:

At the root (2), res = 1.
    Calls Dfs(node.left, maxVal = 2):
        At node 1 (left child), res = 0.
            Calls Dfs(node.left, maxVal = 2):
                At node 3, res = 1 (because 3 >= 2).
                Both children are null, so returns 1.
            Right child is null, so returns 1 to the parent 1 node.
    Cumulative res for the left subtree rooted at the first 1 is 1.
    Calls Dfs(node.right, maxVal = 2):
        At node 1 (right child), res = 0.
            Calls Dfs(node.left, maxVal = 2):
                At node 1, res = 0 (no new good nodes).
                Both children are null, so returns 0.
            Calls Dfs(node.right, maxVal = 2):
                At node 5, res = 1 (because 5 >= 2).
                Both children are null, so returns 1.
    Cumulative res for the right subtree rooted at the second 1 is 1.
The final return is 3, which is the sum of all good nodes in the tree.

Key Takeaway:
The "summing" youâ€™re asking about happens automatically via the recursive accumulation (res += Dfs(...)) for each node. 
This pattern is common in recursive depth-first search algorithms where results are combined as the recursion unwinds.

/*
Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree

Within a binary tree, a node x is considered good if the path from the root of the tree 
to the node x contains no nodes with a value greater than the value of node x

Given the root of a binary tree root, return the number of good nodes within the tree.

Example 1:
Input: root = [2,1,1,3,null,1,5]
Output: 3 - the three good nodes are (2, 2->1-3, 2->1->5)

        2
   1         1
 3  null    1  5 


Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2,-1,3,4]
Output: 4 - the four good nodes are (1, 1->2, 1->2->3, 1->2->4)

        1
   2         -1
 3  4    


Constraints:
1 <= number of nodes in the tree <= 100
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
