/*
Word Search

Given a 2-D grid of characters board and a string word, return true if 
the word is present in the grid, otherwise return false.

For the word to be present it must be possible to form it with a path 
in the board with horizontally or vertically neighboring cells. The same 
cell may not be used more than once in a word.

Example 1:
Input: 
board = [
  ["A","B","C","D"],
  ["S","A","A","T"],
  ["A","C","A","E"]
],
word = "CAT"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: 
board = [
  ["A","B","C","D"],
  ["S","A","A","T"],
  ["A","C","A","E"]
],
word = "BAT"
Output: false

Constraints:
1 <= board.length, board[i].length <= 5
1 <= word.length <= 10
board and word consists of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.
