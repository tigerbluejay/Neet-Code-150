/*
Min Cost to Connect Points

You are given a 2-D integer array points, where points[i] = [xi, yi]. 
Each points[i] represents a distinct point on a 2-D plane.

The cost of connecting two points [xi, yi] and [xj, yj] is the manhattan distance between the two points, 
i.e. |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|.

Return the minimum cost to connect all points together, such that there exists exactly one path between 
each pair of points.

Example 1:
Input: points = [[0,0],[2,2],[3,3],[2,4],[4,2]]
Output: 10

Constraints:
1 <= points.length <= 1000
-1000 <= xi, yi <= 1000
