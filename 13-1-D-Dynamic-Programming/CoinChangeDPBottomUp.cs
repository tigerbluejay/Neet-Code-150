/*
Coin Change

You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different 
denominations (e.g. 1 dollar, 5 dollars, etc) and an integer amount 
representing a target amount of money.

Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up the exact target 
amount. If it is impossible to make up the amount, return -1.

You may assume that you have an unlimited number of each coin.

Example 1:
Input: coins = [1,5,10], amount = 12
Output: 3
Explanation: 12 = 10 + 1 + 1. Note that we do not have to use every kind 
coin available.

Example 2:
Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1
Explanation: The amount of 3 cannot be made up with coins of 2.

Example 3:
Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
Output: 0
Explanation: Choosing 0 coins is a valid way to make up 0.

Constraints:
1 <= coins.length <= 10
1 <= coins[i] <= 2^31 - 1
0 <= amount <= 10000
