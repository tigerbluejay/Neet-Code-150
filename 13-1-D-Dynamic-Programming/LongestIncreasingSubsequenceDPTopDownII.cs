ðŸŒ³ Recursion Tree for nums = [9, 1, 4, 2, 3, 3, 7]

Each node represents LISDPTDIIDfs(nums, i):

DPTDIILengthOfLIS:
  i=0 -> LIS(0) = 1                  // 9 can't grow, as all later numbers are smaller
  i=1 -> LIS(1) = 4
    â”œâ”€ j=2 (4) -> LIS(2) = 3
    â”‚   â”œâ”€ j=4 (3) -> LIS(4) = 2
    â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€ j=6 (7) -> LIS(6) = 1
    â”‚   â””â”€ j=6 (7)
    â””â”€ j=6 (7)
  i=2 -> LIS(2) = 3
    â”œâ”€ j=4 (3) -> LIS(4) = 2
    â”‚   â””â”€ j=6 (7)
    â””â”€ j=6 (7)
  i=3 -> LIS(3) = 2
    â””â”€ j=4 (3)
        â””â”€ j=6 (7)
  i=4 -> LIS(4) = 2
    â””â”€ j=6 (7)
  i=5 -> LIS(5) = 2
    â””â”€ j=6 (7)
  i=6 -> LIS(6) = 1

This approach treats each index as the potential start of an increasing subsequence. 
It uses recursion to explore how long a subsequence can grow from that index by comparing 
to every element ahead of it.

Hereâ€™s the process for nums = [9, 1, 4, 2, 3, 3, 7]:

Start from index 0 (value 9). No future values are larger, so the LIS from here is just 1.

At index 1 (value 1), you can go to:
4 â†’ 2 â†’ 3 â†’ 7: a chain of 4 elements â†’ LIS = 4.

From index 2 (value 4), you can go to 7, or to 3 and then 7 â†’ LIS = 3.
Index 3 (2) can go to 3 â†’ 7, or directly to 7 â†’ LIS = 2.

Index 4 and 5 (3s) can go to 7 â†’ LIS = 2.

Index 6 (7) has no valid continuation â†’ LIS = 1.

The maximum among all these gives the final result: 4.

/*
Longest Increasing Subsequence

Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing 
subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting 
some or no elements without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "cat" is a subsequence of "crabt".

Example 1:
Input: nums = [9,1,4,2,3,3,7]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [1,2,3,7], which has a length of 4.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,3,1,3,2,3]
Output: 4

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 1000
-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
