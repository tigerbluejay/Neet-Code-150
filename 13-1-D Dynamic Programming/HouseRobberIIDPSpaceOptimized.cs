We compute the max between two cases:

ðŸŸ¦ Case A: Exclude first â†’ [9, 8, 3, 6]

Start: rob1 = 0, rob2 = 0

House: 9
â†’ newRob = max(0 + 9, 0) = 9
â†’ rob1 = 0, rob2 = 9

House: 8
â†’ newRob = max(0 + 8, 9) = 9
â†’ rob1 = 9, rob2 = 9

House: 3
â†’ newRob = max(9 + 3, 9) = 12
â†’ rob1 = 9, rob2 = 12

House: 6
â†’ newRob = max(9 + 6, 12) = 15
â†’ rob1 = 12, rob2 = 15
âœ… Max for Case A = 15

ðŸŸ© Case B: Exclude last â†’ [2, 9, 8, 3]
Start: rob1 = 0, rob2 = 0

House: 2
â†’ newRob = max(0 + 2, 0) = 2
â†’ rob1 = 0, rob2 = 2

House: 9
â†’ newRob = max(0 + 9, 2) = 9
â†’ rob1 = 2, rob2 = 9

House: 8
â†’ newRob = max(2 + 8, 9) = 10
â†’ rob1 = 9, rob2 = 10

House: 3
â†’ newRob = max(9 + 3, 10) = 12
â†’ rob1 = 10, rob2 = 12

âœ… Max for Case B = 12

âœ… Final Answer:
return Math.Max(15, 12); // â†’ 15

/*
House Robber II

You are given an integer array nums where nums[i] represents the amount of money 
the ith house has. The houses are arranged in a circle, i.e. the first house and the 
last house are neighbors.

You are planning to rob money from the houses, but you cannot rob two adjacent houses 
because the security system will automatically alert the police if two adjacent houses 
were both broken into.

Return the maximum amount of money you can rob without alerting the police.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,4,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: You cannot rob nums[0] + nums[2] = 6 because nums[0] and nums[2] are 
adjacent houses. The maximum you can rob is nums[1] = 4.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,9,8,3,6]
Output: 15
Explanation: You cannot rob nums[0] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 16 because nums[0] and 
nums[4] are adjacent houses. The maximum you can rob is nums[1] + nums[4] = 15.

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 100
0 <= nums[i] <= 100
