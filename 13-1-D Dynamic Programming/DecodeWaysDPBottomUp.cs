âœ… 2. Tree-like Structure for Input "1342"
Letâ€™s simulate the bottom-up table filling process for s = "1342":

ðŸ§¾ Tree-Like Output (Notepad Friendly)

BUNumDecodings("1342")

Index: 3, Char: '2'
    dp[3] = 1   // '2' is valid â†’ 1 way (dp[4])

Index: 2, Char: '4'
    dp[2] = 1   // '4' is valid â†’ dp[3]
    '42' is invalid as a pair â†’ no dp[4] added

Index: 1, Char: '3'
    dp[1] = 1   // '3' is valid â†’ dp[2]
    '34' is invalid â†’ no dp[3] added

Index: 0, Char: '1'
    dp[0] = 1   // '1' is valid â†’ dp[1]
    '13' is valid â†’ dp[2] added
    dp[0] = 1 + 1 = 2

/*
Decode Ways

A string consisting of uppercase english characters can be encoded to a 
number using the following mapping:

'A' -> "1"
'B' -> "2"
...
'Z' -> "26"

To decode a message, digits must be grouped and then mapped back into 
letters using the reverse of the mapping above. There may be multiple ways 
to decode a message. For example, "1012" can be mapped into:

"JAB" with the grouping (10 1 2)
"JL" with the grouping (10 12)
The grouping (1 01 2) is invalid because 01 cannot be mapped into a letter 
since it contains a leading zero.

Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to 
decode it. You can assume that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

Example 1:
Input: s = "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: "12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).

Example 2:
Input: s = "01"
Output: 0
Explanation: "01" cannot be decoded because "01" cannot be mapped into a letter.

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 100
s consists of digits
