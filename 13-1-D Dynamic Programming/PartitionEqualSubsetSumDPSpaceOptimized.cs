ðŸ§  Explanation in Prose

This 1D bottom-up DP algorithm simulates the same logic as the 2D version but uses 
less memory. Instead of maintaining a full 2D table dp[i][j], it keeps just two 1D 
arrays (dp and nextDp) representing the previous and current states.

We start with dp[0] = true (base case: zero sum is always possible).
For each number in nums, we try to "build up" to the target sum.
nextDp[j] = true if we can reach sum j:
Either by not including the current number (dp[j])
Or by including the current number (dp[j - nums[i]])

At each step, we update nextDp, and then swap it into dp for the next iteration. 
After processing all numbers, dp[target] tells us whether the target sum is achievable.

ðŸŒ³ Copy-Paste-Friendly Recursive-Call-Like Trace Tree
ðŸŸ¡ This algorithm is iterative, but weâ€™ll mimic the idea of what each stage 
"looks like" when building up to target = 5 for:

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]

Start:
dp = [T, F, F, F, F, F]

Processing 1:
nextDp = [T, T, F, F, F, F]

Processing 2:
nextDp = [T, T, T, T, F, F]

Processing 3:
nextDp = [T, T, T, T, T, T]

Processing 4:
nextDp = [T, T, T, T, T, T]  (unchanged since all reachable sums were already set)

âœ… Final dp[5] = true â†’ return true


ðŸ§® Example Reasoning for a Few Key Entries
Target j	Explanation at some step
dp[0]	Always true â€” base case
dp[1]	1 is in the array â†’ can form 1
dp[3]	1+2=3 or 3 directly
dp[5]	2+3=5 or 1+4=5 â†’ reachable

You can think of it as a growing set of reachable sums.

Initial dp (before processing any number):

/*
The algorithm only cares if dp[target] is true at the end, not all entries in dp.
If dp[target] is false, the answer is false.
The other dp[j] entries just track which sums are possible at intermediate steps.

/*
Partition Equal Subset Sum

You are given an array of positive integers nums.
Return true if you can partition the array into two subsets, 
subset1 and subset2 where sum(subset1) == sum(subset2). Otherwise, return false.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: true
Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 4] and [2, 3].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: false

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 50
