/*
What's Happening?

We're not actually building the LIS sequence itself.

We're maintaining a greedy front: the dp list has the smallest possible end 
values for subsequences of various lengths.

If a number extends the longest subsequence â†’ append.
If not â†’ replace a value to keep the subsequences optimally low.

This method achieves O(n log n) time due to binary search.
*/

/*
Purpose of BinarySearch in LIS
It finds the position in the dp list where the current number should be placed or 
replaced to maintain a growing list of optimal "tails" for increasing subsequences.

ðŸ“¦ What is dp holding?
dp[i] = the smallest possible tail value of any increasing subsequence of length i + 1.

So dp is always sorted in ascending order, which is why binary search works.

/*
Longest Increasing Subsequence

Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing 
subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting 
some or no elements without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "cat" is a subsequence of "crabt".

Example 1:
Input: nums = [9,1,4,2,3,3,7]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [1,2,3,7], which has a length of 4.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,3,1,3,2,3]
Output: 4

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 1000
-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
